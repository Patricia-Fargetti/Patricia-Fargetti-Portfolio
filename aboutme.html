<h1> Patricia Fargetti</h1>
<h2> Junior Web Developer </h2>

	<p> I've always had a drive for craft and design so throughout the last 4 years I have expressed this in my work as a <spam class="underline"> pastry cook</spam> where I make delicious and beautiful treats.
My passion to design and to create has led me to a different journey that is studying computer programming. I am excited about this road that's ahead of me, to learn, to problem solve, and to develop . I believe that the skills I have gained as a Front-End Web Developer in the past year will contribute in this growing industry. I have a strong desire to work in a team that will help create optimized and creative websites that showcases amazing brands and products.
